# Neal: When working with CodeIgniter I'm usually in the applications folder.
# This function will allow you to call vmod from $ and it will open up each
# correspoding file from the CI architechure (MVC).
# Example: "$ vmod users" from the applications directory will open up 
# controllers/users.php, models/users_m.php, and views/users_view.php (or views/users/....php).
function vmod() {
    if [ -d views/${1} ]; then
        screen vim -p controllers/${1}.php \

    else
        screen vim -p controllers/${1}.php \
        models/${1}_m.php \
